              The Urantia Book, first published by the Urantia Foundation in 1955, is a spiritual, philosophical, and religious book that originated in Chicago sometime between 1924 and 1955. The authorship remains a matter of speculation, but the book purports to have been presented by celestial beings as a revelation to our world (Urantia).
