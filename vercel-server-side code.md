You don't necessarily need another service if you're already paying for Vercel hosting. While Vercel is primarily known for frontend hosting, it also supports backend functionality through its Serverless Functions feature.

Vercel Functions allow you to run server-side code without managing a separate server. They can handle API endpoints, authentication, and even database connections, which are the core components of your CMS features.

Here's how you can leverage Vercel for both frontend and backend:

API Routes: Vercel supports API routes out of the box. You can create API endpoints in your project's /api directory, and Vercel will automatically deploy them as serverless functions.

Serverless Functions: For more complex backend logic, you can use Vercel Functions. These are Node.js functions that can handle HTTP requests and perform server-side operations.

Database Connections: Vercel Functions can connect to external databases. You'll need to set up environment variables in your Vercel project settings to securely store connection strings.

Authentication: You can implement authentication logic within your Vercel Functions or API routes.

To set up your backend on Vercel:

Create an /api directory in your project root (if not already present)

Place your server-side code in this directory

Vercel will automatically detect and deploy these as API routes/serverless functions

For your CMS features, you might need to adjust your code to work within the serverless paradigm, but it's entirely possible to run a full-stack application on Vercel without needing a separate backend hosting service.

If your backend requirements are particularly complex or resource-intensive, then considering a separate backend hosting service might be beneficial. However, for most applications, Vercel's serverless approach should be sufficient and can simplify your deployment process by keeping everything on one platform.
